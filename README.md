# COVID-19
In this project we present and address two problem statements  which  are  one  of  the  most  important  and  have  been one  of  the  gravest  concerns  in  the  post  COVID-19  outbreak world. In our first challenge we try to predict the global turnout of the pandemic pertaining to each and every country, for certain range  of  dates  in  April  and  May,  specific  to  the  parameters  of confirmed  cases  and  fatalities.  In  our  second  challenge,  we  try to predict the same outcomes, for the same period, but for each individual  state  and  territory  of  the  United  States.  We  evaluate and discuss our outcomes, present different implementations and the  reasoning  behind  the  chosen  approaches,  accompanied  by  a graphical  representation  of  our  results  and  an  apt  conclusion.
